/** @defgroup regression_testing Regression Testing

The regression testing system allows the recording and playback of command-line
interface (CLI-based) tests. These tests are aimed at detecting regressions in
bitshares clients at the functional level. 

Verification is performed by comparing the results of the command-line
interface log session for each client against a golden-reference log session.
Input for each client from the testcomes from these same golden reference log
files.

The tests are stored in bitshares_toolkit\test as follows:

regression_tests\
  one_client_test\
    test.config
    client.log
  two_client_test\
    test.config
    client1.log
	client2.log
  ...

In the above example, two_client_test consists of a single test run that
launches two clients. The test.config file tells the test how to configure the
two clients, and in this example contains:

@code
client1 --input-log=client1.log --upnp=false
client2 --input-log=client2.log --upnp=false
@endcode

The --input-log says to create one client named client1 and send it CLI input
commands from clien1.log and create a second client named client2 and send
it CLI input commands from client2.log. Each client can also be configured
with other bitshares_command line arguments as desired (e.g. --unpn=false).

Regression Test Results Directories
-----------------------------------

If no data-dir is supplied as a command-line argument (this is the preferred
operation for regression tests except for one's testing this specific functionality),
the regression test run will be recorded in an output directory parallel to the
bitshares_toolkit source directory. For example, if your source is located in:

@code
\gh\bitshare_toolkit
@endcode

then the regression tests output will be stored as:

@code
\gh\regression_tests_output\
  one_client_test\
    client.log
  two_client_test\
    client1.log
	client2.log
@endcode

The CLI output logs in these directories can be visually diffed for changes whenever
there is a mismatch between an input log file located under the regression_tests directory and
the corresponding output log file located under the regression_tests_output directory.

Launching the Regression Tests
------------------------------
Currently, regression tests are inappropriately located in "wallet_test".
To run the tests, run:

@code
cd bitshares_toolkit\test
wallet_tests  -t regression_tests_without_network
@endcode

Developing and Testing a Single Test
------------------------------------
The above command runs all the tests in the regresssion_tests directory. 
While developing a test, you will often only want to run your test. 
The easiest way to do this right now is to temporarily rename regression_tests dir to
something like regression_tests_x, then create a new regresssion_tests dir and put just
your test subdir inside it.

Creating a Regression Test
--------------------------
To create a regression test, you need to do perform the following steps:

1. Create a new test directory under test\regression_tests (e.g. my_test)
2. Record a log session using the bitshares client for each client that will
   be involved in your test, and copy the console.log for that client to your
   test directory, renaming the log files so that they don't conflict with each other.
   You can add delays between the execution of commands in your script
   using the "wait" command (e.g. "wait 60" to wait 60 seconds before executing the next command).   
3. Generally, you should type "quit" as the last line in your script to avoid the test
   stopping at a command prompt and prompting for console input after the script finishes.
   However, you may want to temporarily remove the quit from a test when you'd like to
   type commands to a client after it's finished executing the script to check the client's
   status, just don't forget to add the quit back to the script afterwards.
4. Create a test.config in your test directory that specifies on each line the
   command-line arguments for a single client. The first parameter on the line
   should be used to name each client. Try to use useful client names when possible.
   For example, if your test is performing a transfer from one client to another,
   you could name the first client "sender" and the second client "receiver".
